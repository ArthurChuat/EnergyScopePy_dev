Presolve eliminates 823404 constraints and 579298 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 4;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
258768 variables, all linear
476970 constraints, all linear; 1455078 nonzeros
	350830 equality constraints
	126140 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.
