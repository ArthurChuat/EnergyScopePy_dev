Presolve eliminates 705479 constraints and 451934 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 6;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
270186 variables, all linear
492470 constraints, all linear; 1547946 nonzeros
	349442 equality constraints
	143028 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.
