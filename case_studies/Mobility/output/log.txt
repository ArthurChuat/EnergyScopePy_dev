Presolve eliminates 708633 constraints and 451934 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 7;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
270186 variables, all linear
493348 constraints, all linear; 1547946 nonzeros
	350320 equality constraints
	143028 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.

Setting $presolve_fixeps < 5.8e-08 or >= 1.22e-07
could change presolve results.
