Presolve eliminates 709223 constraints and 451934 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 6;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
270186 variables, all linear
492758 constraints, all linear; 1547946 nonzeros
	349730 equality constraints
	143028 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.
