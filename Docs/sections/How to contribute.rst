EnergyScope is an open-source, documented and collaborative energy system model.
The community warmly welcome new members. This section explain how to contribute.



Guidelines
==========

This section explains how the material generated by the community is handled.
There are three types of material:

- Repositories: codes and algorithms
- Documentations: the current file (and all version adapted to other extensions)
- Communication: a platform to quick chat with other users/developers.

In the following, we detail the roles, structure and rules to respect to join the community.
Without directly contributing, everyone is welcome to clone the repository and develop it under the Apache 2.0 License.

Repositories
------------

The EnergyScope project has several repositories:

- EnergyScope: snapshot and simplest version (current documentation). Should be the most stable.
- EnergyScope_pathway: TODO
- EnergyScope_multi_cells: TODO
- ...: TODO

Each of the models have a master version and branches. The master version should remain short, simple and interoperable
with the EnergyScope repository master version. Master branches should be the entry point to a new repository.

The accesses to the repository are restricted to few people. Development must be cross checked before published on the
master branch. The following list summarises the different developers roles:

- Administrator: full rights (see :ref:`sec_releases` )
-
